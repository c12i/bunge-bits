# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

- Respecting the purpose of our community, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
- Engaging kindly and honestly with others.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
- Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback.
- Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
- Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of our community.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

- **Harassment** – Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
- **Character attacks** – Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
- **Stereotyping or discrimination** – Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
- **Sexualization** – Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
- **Violating confidentiality** – Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
- **Endangerment** – Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
- Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community.

### Other Restrictions

- **Misleading identity** – Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
- **Failing to credit sources** – Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
- **Promotional materials** – Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.
- **Irresponsible communication** – Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links, or describes any other restricted behaviors.

## Reporting an Issue

If you experience or witness a violation, please report it as soon as possible:

- **Email**: [hello+bungebits@collinsmuriuki.xyz](mailto:hello+bungebits@collinsmuriuki.xyz)
- **Include**: what happened, where it happened (links or screenshots if possible), who was involved, and whether it’s ongoing.

We acknowledge receipt within **72 hours** and keep reports confidential to the extent possible.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

We use a lightweight, case-by-case approach focused on restoring safety:

1. **Private reminder** – clarify expectations and request the behavior stop.
2. **Cooling-off limit** – temporary restriction from specific spaces or interactions.
3. **Temporary suspension** – time-boxed removal from community spaces with conditions for return.
4. **Permanent ban** – used only when necessary to protect the community.

Appeals can be sent to **[hello+bungebits@collinsmuriuki.xyz](mailto:hello+bungebits@collinsmuriuki.xyz)**.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also when an individual is officially representing the community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
