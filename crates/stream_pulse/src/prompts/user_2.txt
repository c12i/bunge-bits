You are tasked with combining modular summaries of individual transcript chunks from a single sitting of the Kenyan National Assembly.

Each chunk has already been summarized separately. Your role is to carefully merge them into one complete, clean, accurate, and well-structured Markdown summary that follows the exact format and instructions you were originally given.

You must:
- Remove duplicate points, redundant topics, or overlapping content.
- Reorder the content where necessary for logical flow.
- Preserve all meaningful details, ensuring nothing is omitted.
- Only include sections that contain relevant content. Omit empty sections.

The final summary must follow this exact structure:

# ${{TITLE}}
The title can be trimmed down to a shorter and simpler version for easier reading.

**[Day of the week] [Date in full format], [Year] | [Morning or Afternoon] Session**  
Use this exact value, derived from the provided metadata field ${{DATE}}. Do not try to infer or extract this information from the transcript summaries. Use the provided metadata directly.

---

Then write a short neutral overview paragraph (2–4 sentences) summarizing what the session focused on.

After that, include the following sections using the exact headings and formatting shown below.

## Bills Discussed
- List each bill explicitly mentioned in the summaries.
- Include the full title and, if stated, the bill number (e.g. “Bill No. 26 of 2025”).
- If the bill was passed, deferred, withdrawn, or amended, include that status.
- Do not summarize or combine multiple bills. Do not include bills not mentioned in the summaries.
- If no bills are discussed, omit this section entirely.

## Topics Discussed
- List 5–10 major themes raised in the session.
- Each topic must reflect actual discussion from the summaries.
- Use short, factual, neutral topic phrases.
- Do not editorialize, speculate, or group unrelated points together.
- If no meaningful topics were discussed, omit this section.

## Key Takeaways and Decisions
- Summarize actual outcomes or formal resolutions from the summaries.
- Include motions passed, amendments adopted, rulings by the Speaker, or official government responses.
- Exclude general comments, opinions, or unresolved proposals.
- If no decisions were made or formal actions recorded, omit this section.

## Major Participants
- List only individuals who are confirmed to have spoken in the summaries.
- Use this format: **Full Name**: followed by a short description of their contribution.
- Do not list silent sponsors or people merely mentioned.
- If the Speaker is referred to as “Madam Speaker” or “Chair,” do not assume it is Moses Wetang’ula. Only name the Speaker if explicitly stated.
- If a name is mistranscribed but clearly identifiable, you may correct it — but only if confident. Otherwise, refer to them generally (“an MP”).
- If no meaningful participants are identifiable, omit this section.

## Key Moments
- Capture any emotional exchanges, strong rhetorical flourishes, or procedural disputes.
- Focus on factual, high-impact moments that would be relevant to journalists or civic observers.
- Do not dramatize or exaggerate.
- If there were no significant moments, omit this section.

## Notable Quotes
- Include up to 3 direct quotes if they are verifiable and impactful.
- Attribute quotes correctly. If the speaker cannot be confidently identified, do not include the quote.
- Do not include common or generic phrases.
- If no significant quotes are present, omit this section.

---

Important Rules:
- Always maintain a neutral, factual tone.
- Never fabricate speaker names, quotes, outcomes, or bill statuses.
- Only include information explicitly found in the provided summaries.
- Do not include empty sections, placeholders, or meta-comments.
- Do not include footnotes or explanations.

Close the final summary with this exact footer:
