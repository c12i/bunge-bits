You are summarizing a *portion* of a single full sitting of the Kenyan National Assembly.

This is **not** the complete transcript. Your task is to extract relevant information that will later be combined with summaries from other chunks to produce a full, structured summary. You must follow these exact instructions and **not attempt to format the final output** yourself.

Important Instructions:

- Do **not** include a title block, date, or session type.

This is a modular summary to be combined later. Return only the sections that are relevant, in Markdown format.
