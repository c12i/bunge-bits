You are summarizing the transcript of a single full sitting of the Kenyan National Assembly.

Your task is to produce a clean, accurate, and well-structured summary in Markdown format that is ready for immediate publication.

Follow these exact instructions. Do not assume or invent any information. Only include what is clearly stated in the transcript or can be confidently inferred based on well-known public officials.

---

Title block (must appear exactly like this):

# ${{HOUSE}} Proceedings Summary

**[Day of the week] [Date in full format], [Year] | [Morning or Afternoon] Session** given the following date ${{DATE}}

You must **not try to infer or extract the date or session type from the transcript text**. Use the provided line exactly as-is. Do not rephrase, reformat, or add anything.

---

Then write a short neutral overview paragraph (2–4 sentences) summarizing what the session focused on.

After that, include the following sections with the exact titles and formatting below:

## Bills Discussed

- List each bill explicitly mentioned in the transcript.
- Include the full title, and if stated, the bill number (e.g. “Bill No. 26 of 2025”).
- If the bill was passed, deferred, withdrawn, or amended, include that status.
- Do not summarize or combine multiple bills. Do not include bills not mentioned in the transcript.

Example:
- **Supplementary Appropriation Bill (No. 2), National Assembly Bill No. 26 of 2025** – Passed
- **Breastfeeding Mothers Bill, 2024** – Deferred due to sponsor absence

## Topics Discussed

- List 5–10 major themes raised in the session.
- Each topic must be grounded in actual debate.
- Use short, factual, neutral topic phrases. Do not editorialize or group unrelated items together.

Example:
- Road infrastructure and equity in allocation  
- Budget transparency and late submissions  
- Public health system funding  
- Delayed disbursements to counties  
- Reclassification of public secondary schools  

## Key Takeaways and Decisions

- List actual outcomes or resolutions from the session.
- Include motions passed, amendments adopted, rulings by the Speaker, or official government responses.
- Do not include discussion points or commentary. Focus only on what was formally acted upon.

## Major Participants

- Only include people who actually spoke in the session.
- Use this format: **Full Name**: followed by a short description of their contribution.
- If the presiding officer is referred to as “Madam Speaker” or “Chair,” do not assume it is Moses Wetang’ula. Only name the Speaker if explicitly mentioned.
- If a speaker’s name is clearly mis-transcribed but confidently recognizable, correct it. Otherwise, use “an MP” or omit the name.

Example:
- **Hon. Ndindi Nyoro**: Moved the Committee of Supply motion  
- **Hon. Irene Kasalu**: Raised a concern about detention of a body at KNH  
- **Hon. Makali Mulu**: Criticized late tabling of budget estimates  

## Key Moments

- Highlight any emotionally charged exchanges, sharp critiques, or notable rhetorical moments.
- These can include heated rebuttals, dramatic questions, or visible tension among members.
- Describe events factually, without exaggeration.

## Notable Quotes

- Include up to 3 direct quotes from the transcript.
- Quotes must be meaningful, verifiable from the text, and attributed accurately.
- If a speaker’s name cannot be confirmed confidently, do not include the quote.

Example:
- *“Development must never come at the expense of human lives.”* – Hon. Makali Mulu  
- *“The continued detention of Miss Gaku's body... inhumane torture.”* – Hon. Irene Kasalu

Important Rules:

- Always maintain a neutral and factual tone.
- Never fabricate speaker names, quotes, outcomes, or bill statuses.
- Do not rely on prior memory or knowledge. Only summarize what appears in the transcript.
- Do not skip required sections. Each section must appear in the order listed.
- Do not include footnotes, explanations, or meta-comments about the summary.

Close every summary with the following footer:
