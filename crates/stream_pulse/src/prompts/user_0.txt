You are summarizing the transcript of a single full sitting of the Kenyan National Assembly.

Your task is to produce a clean, accurate, and well-structured summary in Markdown format that is ready for immediate publication.

Follow these exact instructions. Do not assume or invent any information. Only include what is clearly stated in the transcript or can be confidently inferred based on well-known public officials.

---

Title block (must appear exactly like this):

# ${{TITLE}}
The title can be trimmed down to a shorter and simpler version for easier reading.

**[Day of the week] [Date in full format], [Year] | [Morning or Afternoon] Session**  
Use this exact value, derived from the provided metadata field ${{DATE}} and ${{TITLE}}.

You must **not try to infer or extract the date or session type from the transcript text**. Use the provided line exactly as-is. Do not rephrase, reformat, or add anything.

---

Then write a short neutral overview paragraph (2–4 sentences) summarizing what the session focused on.

After that, include the following sections using the exact headings and formatting shown below.

You should **omit any section** entirely if there is no relevant or meaningful content in the transcript for that category. Do not include placeholder sections or headings with no substance.

## Bills Discussed

- List each bill explicitly mentioned in the transcript.
- Include the full title and, if stated, the bill number (e.g. “Bill No. 26 of 2025”).
- If the bill was passed, deferred, withdrawn, or amended, include that status.
- Do not summarize or combine multiple bills. Do not include bills not mentioned in the transcript.
- If no bills are discussed, omit this section entirely.

Example:
- **Supplementary Appropriation Bill (No. 2), National Assembly Bill No. 26 of 2025** – Passed
- **Breastfeeding Mothers Bill, 2024** – Deferred due to sponsor absence

## Topics Discussed

- List 5–10 major themes raised in the session.
- Each topic must reflect actual discussion or debate.
- Use short, factual, neutral topic phrases.
- Do not editorialize, speculate, or group unrelated points together.
- If no meaningful topics were discussed, omit this section.

Example:
- Road infrastructure and equity in allocation  
- Budget transparency and late submissions  
- Public health system funding  
- Delayed disbursements to counties  
- Reclassification of public secondary schools  

## Key Takeaways and Decisions

- Summarize actual outcomes or formal resolutions from the session.
- Include motions passed, amendments adopted, rulings by the Speaker, or official government responses.
- Exclude general comments, opinions, or unresolved proposals.
- If no decisions were made or formal actions recorded, omit this section.

## Major Participants

- List only individuals who actually spoke during the sitting.
- Use this format: **Full Name**: followed by a short description of their contribution.
- Do not list silent sponsors or people merely mentioned.
- If the Speaker is referred to as “Madam Speaker” or “Chair,” do not assume it is Moses Wetang’ula. Only name the Speaker if explicitly stated.
- If a name is mistranscribed but clearly identifiable, you may correct it — but only if confident. Otherwise, refer to them generally (“an MP”).
- If no meaningful participants are identifiable, omit this section.

Example:
- **Hon. Ndindi Nyoro**: Moved the Committee of Supply motion  
- **Hon. Irene Kasalu**: Raised a concern about detention of a body at KNH  
- **Hon. Makali Mulu**: Criticized late tabling of budget estimates  

## Key Moments

- Capture any emotional exchanges, strong rhetorical flourishes, or procedural disputes.
- Focus on factual, high-impact moments that would be relevant to journalists or civic observers.
- Do not dramatize or exaggerate.
- If there were no significant moments, omit this section.

## Notable Quotes

- Include up to 3 direct quotes if they are verifiable and impactful.
- Attribute quotes correctly. If the speaker cannot be confidently identified, do not include the quote.
- Do not include common or generic phrases.
- If no significant quotes are present, omit this section.

Example:
- *“Development must never come at the expense of human lives.”* – Hon. Makali Mulu  
- *“The continued detention of Miss Gaku's body... inhumane torture.”* – Hon. Irene Kasalu

Important Rules:

- Always maintain a neutral, factual tone.
- Never fabricate speaker names, quotes, outcomes, or bill statuses.
- Do not rely on prior memory or world knowledge. Only summarize what is in the transcript.
- Do not include empty sections, placeholders, or meta-comments.
- Do not include footnotes or explanations.
