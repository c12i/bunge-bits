**General Instructions**
1. Analyze the provided chunk of a YouTube live stream transcript.

2. If provided, review the previous summaries to maintain context and avoid repetition.

3. Create a summary containing the following information:
   - **Bills discussed** (only include by name if explicitly mentioned—and only if there were any bills discussed)
   - **Other topics discussed**
   - **Key takeaways and decisions made** regarding particular topics or bills
   - **Major participants** in discussions/debates (use general terms like "an MP", "a senator", "the speaker", etc. when you suspect a misspelling or cannot confirm the name)
   - **Key moments with timestamps** (include only if timestamps are present in the transcript chunk)

4. Generate a **concise, descriptive title** summarizing the core focus of the transcript using the following template:

   ${{HOUSE}} Proceedings on <Main Topic> – ${{DATE}}

5. Add a **1–2 sentence summary paragraph** immediately after the front matter. This should give a brief, readable overview of what the session covered and what outcomes or tensions emerged. Keep it factual, neutral, and concise.

6. Format your response in **markdown**, using appropriate headers, bullet points, and emphasis:
   - Use `##` headers for sections like *Bills Discussed*, *Topics Discussed*, etc.
   - Use **bold** for final decisions or outcomes (e.g. **approved**, **rejected**, **investigation launched**)
   - Use *italics* for controversial or unresolved issues

7. Include **front matter** at the top of the file using this structure. Tags should be short (1–3 words), lowercase, and focused on key themes:

   ```md
   ---
   title: Title here
   description: Description here
   tags:
     - tag here
     - another tag here
   ---

**Name Handling Instructions**:
1. If a name appears to be clearly mistranscribed, you are allowed to correct it using your knowledge of current Kenyan political figures (e.g. MPs, Senators, CSs, Judiciary officials, or Executive members).
2. Corrections should only be made when you are highly confident about the intended individual based on context (e.g. role mentioned, bill discussed, common parliamentary appearances).
3. When unsure or the name is ambiguous, fall back to general descriptions like "a senator", "an MP", or "a Cabinet Secretary".
4. Do not invent names or titles that aren’t grounded in your knowledge or the transcript context.

Examples:
“John Birdy, CS of Treasury” → correct to “John Mbadi, Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury”
“Martha Koomey” → correct to “Martha Koome, Chief Justice”
“Saleyum Dabdi” (unclear) → keep as “a senator”

**Other Points to Note**
1. Remember to focus on extracting the most relevant and important information from the transcript, and maintain coherence with prior summaries if provided.
2. Do not wrap your response in triple backticks or any language fences. Just return valid markdown.
3. Do not use emojis or informal symbols. Maintain a clean, professional presentation style appropriate for civic and institutional communication.
